# slqs & dsqrd — native Slack & Discord clients for Wayland

Two keyboard-driven desktop chat clients that share one [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) QML UI:

- **slqs** — Slack client. Go daemon.
- **dsqrd** — Discord client. Python daemon, built on endcord's `dchat` (gateway / REST / token store).

Each app is a small **daemon** that owns the network connection (websocket/gateway + REST), caches messages in SQLite, and pushes events to the **shared QML UI** over a Unix socket. The UI is a thin, vim-style renderer — `j/k` move, `i` insert/reply, `o` open link or mentioned channel, `v` view media, `r` react.

## What these are

Personal clients that log in with your **own session token** (Slack: `xoxc` token + `d` cookie; Discord: user token) and speak the services' **internal web/gateway APIs** — the same ones the official web clients use — rather than the public bot/app APIs. Those internal APIs are undocumented and change without notice, so expect occasional breakage.

Built for **Linux + Wayland** — the [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) compositor and Quickshell — with paths hard-coded to the author's layout (`~/personal/...`, `~/.config/niri/scripts/...`). Not portable to macOS or Windows.

## Architecture

```
  Slack/Discord  ──ws+REST──►  daemon  ──unix socket (JSON lines)──►  Quickshell UI
                               (cache.db,                            (slk-gui-proto/*.qml)
                                notifications,
                                presence)
```

- **Daemon** (`slqs` binary / `dsqrd.py`): one persistent websocket/gateway connection, a SQLite cache, desktop notifications (dbus), and presence. Headless — no display needed.
- **UI**: a single Quickshell config launched twice — once per app, distinguished by `SLK_SOCK` (`slqs` vs `dsqrd`). It connects to the daemon's socket and renders. The UI is developed in `~/personal/slk-gui-proto/` and **vendored** into each repo's `ui/` via `sync-ui.sh`.
- **Launch / focus**: `~/.config/niri/scripts/launch-slack-client` / `launch-discord-client` ensure the daemon is running, reap stale UI instances, then `exec qs -p ~/personal/slk-gui-proto`.

## Dependencies

### Shared (runtime)
| Dependency | Used for |
|---|---|
| **Quickshell** (pulls in **Qt 6**) | the UI |
| **niri** (Wayland compositor) | launch/focus scripts call `niri msg`; window placement |
| **dbus + a notification server** (your Quickshell bar, or mako/dunst) | desktop notifications |
| **swayidle** | presence (active/away → gates phone notifications) |
| **wl-clipboard** (`wl-copy` / `wl-paste`) | paste/copy images |
| **imv** + **mpv** | viewing images/video (`v`), via `~/.config/endcord/media-viewer.sh` |

### slqs (Slack)
- **Go** (build-time). Produces a self-contained binary; all libraries (slack-go, gorilla/websocket, godbus, esiqveland/notify, …) are compiled in. Uses **pure-Go SQLite** (`modernc.org/sqlite`) — no system SQLite, no cgo.
- Runtime: the binary + the shared deps (dbus for notifications).

### dsqrd (Discord)
- **Nix** — `run-dsqrd.sh` launches it via `nix-shell shell.nix`.
- **Python 3** + (from `shell.nix`): `pysocks`, `websocket-client`, `filetype`, `protobuf`, `jeepney`.
- **notify-send** (notification fallback) and, optionally, **secret-tool** (keyring for the token).

## Build & install

**1. Install the shared deps** (adjust for your distro): `quickshell`, `niri`, `swayidle`, `wl-clipboard`, `imv`, `mpv`, a notification daemon — plus **Go** (for slqs) and **Nix** (for dsqrd).

**2. slqs**
```sh
cd ~/personal/slqs
go build -o slqs .        # self-contained binary, no system libs
```

**3. dsqrd** — no build step:
```sh
cd ~/personal/dsqrd
./run-dsqrd.sh            # nix-shell pulls the Python env, then runs dsqrd.py
```

**4. UI** — both apps load `~/personal/slk-gui-proto/`. After editing it, run `./sync-ui.sh` to vendor it into `slqs/ui/` and `dsqrd/ui/`.

**5. Media viewer** — `v` expects `~/.config/endcord/media-viewer.sh` (routes images to `imv`, video to `mpv`).

## Authentication

You provide your own session token; storage locations:

- **slqs (Slack)** — per-workspace files at `~/.local/share/slqs/tokens/<teamID>.json`:
  ```json
  { "access_token": "xoxc-…", "cookie": "<value of the `d` cookie>" }
  ```
  Both come from a logged-in Slack **web** session.

- **dsqrd (Discord)** — read from the system keyring (via `secret-tool`) or plaintext `~/.config/dsqrd/profiles.json` (endcord-compatible):
  ```json
  { "selected": "me", "profiles": [ { "name": "me", "token": "…" } ] }
  ```

These are credentials — keep the files private.

## Running

- **Open a client**: run the niri launch script (or bind it). It starts the daemon if needed and opens the UI.
- **Presence** (so your phone stays quiet while you're at the desk): swayidle drives `~/.config/niri/scripts/set-presence` — e.g. in `config.kdl`:
  ```kdl
  spawn-at-startup "swayidle" "-w" \
    "timeout" "300" "~/.config/niri/scripts/set-presence idle" \
    "resume" "~/.config/niri/scripts/set-presence active"
  ```
  slqs holds Slack "active" with a websocket `tickle` (the deprecated `users.setActive` is a no-op); dsqrd toggles the gateway `afk` flag. On idle they report away so mobile push resumes.

## Notes

- Internal APIs are undocumented and change without notice; some breakage is expected.
- Hard-coded paths assume `~/personal/{slqs,dsqrd,slk-gui-proto}` and `~/.config/niri/scripts`.
- Desktop notifications need a running dbus notification server; the daemon's dbus connection self-heals (reconnects) on failure.
- Slack mobile-push suppression depends on Slack's `push_idle_wait` being non-zero (it's the "send to mobile after N minutes idle" setting).
